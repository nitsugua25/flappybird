Making a flappyBird game with python and pygame

## Getting Started
I created a main file with the game loop and a player file with the player class and a pipe file with the pipe class

### the player class
The player class has the following attributes:
* x: the x position of the player is the center of the screen
* y: the y position of the player is the center of the screen
* width: the width of the player is the width of the image
* height: the height of the player is the height of the image
* the 3 images of the player is stored in a list for the animation

The player class has the following methods:
* update: the update method is used to make the player jump when the spacebar is pressed else the player falls down
* animation: the animation method is used to animate the player when the player jumps
